Description: Post-GFC derivatives reforms have lifted the veil off
  over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets. Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs)
  and Swap Data Repositories (SDRs) now publish data on swaps that are traded
  on or reported to those facilities (respectively). This package provides you
  the ability to get this data from supported sources.
