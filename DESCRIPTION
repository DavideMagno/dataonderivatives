Description: Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs) are becoming increasingly
 important venues for transacting Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives. These
 must make publicly available price, volume and other data in relation to
 derivatives transacted on their venues. This package provides a coherent
 interface to access the key SEF venues.
