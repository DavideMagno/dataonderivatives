Description: Post-GFC derivatives reforms have lifted the veil off
  over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets. Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs)
  and Swap Data Repositories (SDRs) now publish data on swaps that are traded
  on those facilities and reported to those repositories (respectively). This
  package provides you the ability to get this data from supported sources.
