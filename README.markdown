# Data on derivatives

Some Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives have been Made Available for Trade (MAT) by the CTFC. This means they must be traded on Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs). These SEFs are compelled to make publically available trading volume and prices for these MAT derivatives on a daily basis. 

This repository is an initial attempt to automate the process of downloading the data from the SEFs, merging them in a coherent manner and presenting the salient results. It is likely this project will evolve over time.
